----

Create [CycloneDX] Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from _[yarn]_ projects.

## Requirements

* `node >= 18`
* `yarn >= 3` (berry)

## Installation

Install the plugin into your yarn project via one of the following methods:

* **zero-install**: No install needed, just call on demand via dlx-wrapper as described in section "usage".
* **cli-wrapper**: As a development dependency of the current project:
  ```shell
  yarn add --dev @cyclonedx/yarn-plugin-cyclonedx
  ```
* **plugin**: Install the [latest version from GitHub release](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-yarn/releases/latest) asset as a plugin for the current project:
  ```shell
  yarn plugin import https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-yarn/releases/latest/download/yarn-plugin-cyclonedx.cjs
  ```

## Usage

Usage depends on the installation method:

* With **zero-install** via dlx-wrapper:
  ```shell
  yarn dlx -q @cyclonedx/yarn-plugin-cyclonedx --help
  ```
* After **cli-wrapper** installation:
  ```shell
  yarn exec cyclonedx-yarn --help
  ```
* After **plugin** installation:
  ```shell 
  yarn cyclonedx --help
  ```

━━━ Usage ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

$ yarn cyclonedx

━━━ Options ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  --spec-version #0        Which version of CycloneDX to use.
                           (choices: 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, default: 1.5)
  --output-format #0       Which output format to use.
                           (choices: JSON, XML, default: JSON)
  --output-file #0         Path to the output file.
                           Set to "-" to write to STDOUT.
                           (default: write to STDOUT)
  --production,--prod      Exclude development dependencies.
                           (default: true if the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to "production", otherwise false)
  --mc-type #0             Type of the main component.
                           (choices: application, library, firmware, default: application)
  --short-PURLs            Omit all qualifiers from PackageURLs.
                           This causes information loss in trade-off shorter PURLs, which might improve ingesting these strings.
  --output-reproducible    Whether to go the extra mile and make the output reproducible.
                           This might result in loss of time- and random-based values.
  --gather-license-texts   Search for license files in components and include them as license evidence.
                           This feature is experimental.
  --verbose,-v             Increase the verbosity of messages.
                           Use multiple times to increase the verbosity even more.

━━━ Details ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Recursively scan workspace dependencies and emits them as 
Software-Bill-of-Materials(SBOM) in CycloneDX format.
```


## Internals

This _yarn_ plugin utilizes the [CycloneDX library][CycloneDX-library] to generate the actual data structures.

This tool does **not** expose any additional _public_ API or classes - all code is intended to be internal and might change without any notice during version upgrades.
However, the CLI is stable - you may call it programmatically like:
```javascript
const { execFileSync } = require('node:child_process')
const { constants: { MAX_LENGTH: BUFFER_MAX_LENGTH } } = require('node:buffer')
const sbom = JSON.parse(execFileSync(process.execPath, [
    '.../path/to/this/package/bin/cyclonedx-yarn-cli.js',
    '--output-format', 'JSON',
    '--output-file', '-'
    // additional CLI args
  ], {stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'ignore'], encoding: 'buffer', maxBuffer: BUFFER_MAX_LENGTH }))
```
